This program allows the user to visualize pathfinding algorithms. The current pathfinding alogrithms that can be displayed are as followed:
- A*
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- BiDirectional

When the alogrithm is searching for a path, it will change the "Tile" color to a random rgb value. If the algorithm is able to find a path,
It will highlight it in a solid green, and prompt the user with a back button to return to the main menu. If it is unable to find a path,
it will prompt the user with a back button.
